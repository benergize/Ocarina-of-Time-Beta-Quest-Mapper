<h1>Ocarina-of-Time-Beta-Quest-Mapper</h1>
It's here at last! The new Ocarina of Time: Beta Quest mapping tool! Easily map out your Beta Quest saves and find the shortest paths between A and B. Let me know if there are bugs/glitches/typos/issues with the zone organization. You can use the demo <a href = 'http://www.benergize.com/betaquest/'>here</a>!

<h2>Instructions</h2>
Use The 'Zone' dropdown to select where you currently are in the game. The 'chart area' will populate with a list of all the doors in that zone. Use the zone/door dropdowns to indicate what zone/entrance each door leads to. As you map, the tool will automatically find paths from your current locationd to a specified location. Save data can be copied or loaded at the bottom of the page.

<h2>Credits</h2>
Credit to mzxrules for making Beta Quest and for compiling the entrance/exit table for OOT, which I found on the ZSR Wiki. Also to vgmaps.com for the maps of Gerudo's Fortress/Thieves' Hideout and Tower Collapse. Thanks to Gabe for helping me run endless tests on the pathfinding (not that he didn't enjoy it) and Isabel for helping me do the final test (she didn't especially enjoy it). The Chiaro font is made by Nintendo(?) and was found on a sketchy Russian website.
